[EDIT] REMARQUE : The Dashboard.html file isn't included because we thought first that we will export sensors data in an app. so it's optional.
🌟 CIVITAS LUMEN — When the City Lights Up, the Future Becomes Clear
CIVITAS LUMEN is more than just a website. It’s a finished product — designed, built, and delivered without compromise. Clean. Green. Thought-out. From the first click to the final detail, everything works exactly as it should.

It’s a static website built with Tailwind CSS, centered on innovation in architecture and technology, created as part of the YTCA 2025 initiative. But more than that, it’s the kind of site you visit once — and you already know there’s nothing to fix.

✔️ What’s Inside:
Fully responsive — it adapts to every screen, every time.

Dashboard page showing live sensor data, no clutter, no confusion.

Architecture section with elegant modals that let you explore without ever getting lost.

Application page, Contact, and a full project showcase — because of course it has them. It’s not a draft.

Green-inspired aesthetic, not just for the eyes, but for the message it sends.

We didn’t leave space for “To-Do” lists. Because what’s done right the first time doesn’t need rethinking.
